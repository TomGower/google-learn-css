# Gradients

Imagine there's an image with a background featuring a purple background with two different shades of purple turning into each other. You might think it requires an image from your design tool to do this, but you can use `linear-gradient` instead.

A gradient is an image and can be used anywhere images can be used, but it's created with CSS and is made up with colors, numbers and angles. CSS gradients allow you to create anything from a smooth gradient between two colors, right up to impressive artwork by mixing and repeating multiple gradients.
